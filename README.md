# Checkers-as-a-Markov-Process

This project involves developing a mathematical framework to analyze and predict the game's outcomes based on the current state of the board and predefined rules. It applies the principles of Markov processes to the game of checkers, transforming it into a quantifiable model suitable for statistical analysis and simulation. The project overview is as follows:

### Project Objective

 - To create a Markov model that accurately represents the game of checkers.
- To analyze game dynamics, predict outcomes, and understand the probabilistic nature of different game states.

### Methodology

**Defining States:** Identifying each possible arrangement of pieces on the checkers board as a distinct state.

**Transition Probabilities:** Calculating the probabilities of moving from one state to another, considering the rules and possible moves in checkers.

### Challenges and Limitations

**State Space Size:** Due to the vast number of potential game states, assumptions were made to make the model computationally feasible.

**Exclusion of Advanced Strategies:** The model does not account for the strategic and adaptive behaviors of human players, who might make decisions based on experience, intuition, or complex strategies.
